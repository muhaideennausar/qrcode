# QR Code Component Challenge

This repository contains my solution to the QR Code Component challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). In this challenge, I was tasked with creating a QR code component using HTML and CSS.

## Challenge Description

The challenge was to build a QR code component that met the following criteria:

* The component should display a QR code image.
* The design should be responsive and look good on both desktop and mobile devices.
* The design should match the provided design files (located in the `design` directory).

## Solution Overview

To complete this challenge, I used HTML and CSS to create a responsive QR code component. Here is an overview of the key files and directories in this repository:

* `index.html:` This HTML file contains the structure of the QR code component. It includes the necessary HTML elements.
* `images/:` This directory contains any images used in the project. In this case, it contains the QR code image that was generated based on the provided URL.
* `design/:` This directory contains the design files provided by Frontend Mentor. It includes both desktop and mobile designs in both light and dark themes.
